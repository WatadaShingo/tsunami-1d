Functionality of MATLAB and Python directories are the same.
Running either a Matplab code or a Python code generates text data files that are used in phase-correction directory.
Please read MATLAB/0README.txt or Python/0README.txt. Also read phase-correction/0README.txt and follow the instructions.

Impatient readers may start with phase-correction/0README.txt

## simulation of dispersive tsunamis in a constant depth ocean

The tsunami dispersion relation is given by the phase velocity as a function of the wave periods.

An example of tsunami dispersion is taken from [**tsunami normal mode**](https://github.com/WatadaShingo/mode-tsunami)
dispersion including the effects of the compressibility of seawater, the elasticity of the Earth, and the
spatio-temporal change in gravity associated with the tsunami motion of seawater and the deformation of the solid Earth.

In the Python directory, Python scripts to generate animations of 1D tsunami propagation have been added.
