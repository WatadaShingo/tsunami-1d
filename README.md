## simulation of dispersive tsunamis in a constant depth ocean

The tsunami dispersion relation is given by the phase velocity as a function of the wave periods.

An example of tsunami dispersion is taken from [**tsunami normal mode**](https://github.com/WatadaShingo/mode-tsunami)
dispersion including the effects of effects of the compressibility of seawater, the elasticity of the Earth, and the
spatio-temporal change in gravity associated with the tsunami motion of seawater and the deformation of the solid Earth.
